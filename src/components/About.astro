    <p class="w-[700px]">
      I am a full stack web developer with a special focus on front-end. My
      curiosity and desire for improvement led me to become a luthier and,
      later, to get involved in the development of websites. My goal is to
      create exceptional online experiences for users, focusing on usability,
      attractive design, and performance optimization.
